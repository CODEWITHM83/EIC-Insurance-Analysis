# EIC Motor Insurance Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of **EIC**, a leading motor insurance provider between **2014 and 2018**. Despite its strong market presence, EIC was forced to shut down in **2019** due to ongoing insurance losses. The purpose of this analysis is to explore financial performance, identify patterns in claims and policies, and uncover key insights that might explain the decline.

Developed using **Microsoft Power BI** and powered by an **Excel dataset**, the dashboard highlights major trends in premiums, claims, customer behavior, and vehicle segment profitability over a 5-year period.

## Objectives
- Analyze total **premiums collected** versus **claims paid** to assess financial health.
- Identify **high-risk vehicle types** and usage segments with high claim rates.
- Explore trends in **policy purchases** across different vehicle categories (e.g., motorcycles, trucks, buses).
